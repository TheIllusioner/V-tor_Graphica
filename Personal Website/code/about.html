            <h2>HI, I'M ILLUSIONER!</h2>
            <p>Welcome aboard the dimensional train! And welcome to <b>V-tor Graphica!</b> My friend <b>QC</b>'s been hard at work to make it possible for people to visit this world, which I believe you see as a website? and I'm here to guide you around! Ask me anything!</p>
            <a onclick="fisheyeMove()"> > What is V-Tor Graphica? How do I get around?</a>

            <h2>About V-Tor Graphica</h2>
            <p><b>V-Tor Graphica</b> is the name of this world I inhabit! (Or I guess in your case, the name of this website). QC and I have been wanting to show people this world and see what we <b>create</b> and <b>think about</b> in our day to day. You can also learn about <b>other characters</b> in this world and other worlds as well! Hope you stick around!</p>
            <p>Use <b>this train</b> to navigate! Above the <b>train doors</b> you can click the <b>arrows</b> to choose your destination, and when you click on the <b>name of your destination</b>, the train should stop and the doors should open. Then you can click <b>outside</b> to exit the train! On the posters around this seat you can find a <b>sitemap</b> if you get lost!</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>As I've said before, my name's Illusioner! I have the power to create anything tactile by <b>combining and splitting</b> apart the shapes that float around in V-Tor Graphica's natural landscape. I can show you sometime! My favorite things to do are to jump into the void, bother QC, and fuck around and find out!</p>
            <p>But if I can break the fourth wall real quick, as V-Tor Graphica's creator, <b>Illusioner</b> is my persona. I'm a Comp Sci major and an undergrad student! Here's a list of other things about me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pronouns: I don't really care if you only know me on the internet tbh, make a guess lmao</li>
                <li>Hobbies: Drawing, animating</li>
                <li>Interests (in no particular order): Animation, anime, world-building, science, suits, music that makes my head explode, psychology, trains, technology, weird things</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Really what I am most excited about for this website is to make a <b>blog!</b> I've loved the idea of screaming my thoughts into the void from a personalized space, so that's what I'm going to do!</p>
            <br>

            <h2>About QC</h2>
            <p>QC is the only person other than me who originates from V-Tor Graphica! She has the power to make anything by <b>creating vertices</b> and connecting them with edges that spawn from her fingertips, and she can completely <b>delete</b> them from existence as well. That might sound a lot more overpowered than me, but it also takes a lot more <b>time</b> for her to make anything useful. She's much more quiet and chill than I am, and is always engrossed in some <b>project</b> she's working on, but you can probably find her near the <b>station to V-Tor Graphica</b> if you want to have a brief chat with her.</p>
            <p>Unlike me, she doesn't represent any real life people. She's sort of like...an aspect of <b>me</b>, I guess. And things are just a lot more interesting with a companion.</p>
